If we are obliged to participate in structural competition, we can still work to reduce personal competitiveness. At the very least, we can shift to what I have called “process competition” by directing attention away from the results of an activity. If we are playing a competitive game, we ought not to keep score. If it will be obvious who wins, we should at least avoid awarding any prizes or making a fuss over the victor. By minimizing the significance of winning, we simultaneously soften the blow of losing. Whenever we take part in a contest, we can try to nest it in fellowship: by making a special effort to fortify the bonds between competitors, the destructive effects of having to work against each other can be eased a bit.

The psychological and interpersonal damage wrought by competition is so severe that we should also let children know of it in explicit terms.

Surely the evidence is clear enough and the stakes high enough. Granted that what we do is more important than what we say; above all, we should not set children against one another and we should not act in such a way as to present them with competitive role models.

From his job, such orientations can be expected to spill over to his family, community, and even society as a whole. This, it will be recalled, is precisely the sort of thing we found in the laboratory.

HOW TO PREVENT SOCIAL CHANGE13   Making our society less competitive ultimately depends on reducing structural competition. Unfortunately, bringing about structural change of any kind requires overcoming enormous resistance. It is much easier to describe how change can be blocked than how it can be furthered. For those so inclined, then, here are five simple ways to perpetuate the status quo. 1. LIMIT YOUR VISION:

By pretending, for example, that psychological disturbance has nothing to do with the societal forces that shape personality development, you can help see to it that those forces continue unabated. It follows that all intervention should be done at the individual level. It is fine to help, say, homeless people on a case-by-case basis, but inquiring into the policy decisions and economic arrangements that have brought about their predicament would only serve to invite drastic changes—and this is what we want to avoid at all costs.

2.    ADAPT: The best way to keep the status quo intact is to make sure that individuals adjust themselves to serve its needs. Such adaptation once was enforced by crude, authoritarian methods of “reeducation.” Today this is hardly necessary. A wealth of advice is available on how to become successful—what to wear, how to negotiate, and so forth—and virtually all of it proceeds from the premise that you should adjust yourself to conditions as you find them. Adaptation is a critical part of the self-help model: you must succeed within the institutions and according to the rules that already exist. To do well is to fit in, and to fit in is to fortify the structures into which you are being fit.

*** 3.    THINK ABOUT YOURSELF: Implicit in any exhortations --
3.    THINK ABOUT YOURSELF: Implicit in any exhortations to succeed by “giving them what they want” is the suggestion that you should be totally preoccupied with your own well-being. The more you limit your concerns to yourself, the more you help to sustain the larger system. But this does not apply merely to material success. Even therapeutic and spiritual enterprises are useful for preserving the status quo because in encouraging you to attend to your own needs, they effectively direct attention away from social structures. Groom yourself and let the rest of the world go on its way—what better strategy is there for perpetuating existing structures? A few people may argue, it is true, that personal growth can be a route to social change. But most of the human potential movement will not require you to wrestle with this question, since social change is irrelevant to its goals and techniques.

As with other features of the status quo, the stakes are highest here for those with the least power. People who have systematically been denied the opportunity to earn a decent wage, to lead a life with dignity, to make decisions about what affects them, may think it peculiar to be told that competition is destructive. After all, they might argue, “my only hope is to enter the race and try to win, to beat them at their own game.” It is not a coincidence that this is precisely the response to oppression encouraged by those who hold the power. First, this strategy rarely works (even in conventional terms) because the deck is stacked: those who already are winners are in better shape to win succeeding contests.

*** The differences between headers and modules are not just --
The differences between headers and modules are not just syntactic. A module is compiled once only (rather than in each translation unit in which it is used). Two modules can be imported in either order without changing their meaning. If you import something into a module, users of your module do not implicitly gain access to (and are not bothered by) what you imported: import is not transitive. The effects on maintainability and compile-time performance can be spectacular.

There are other paths through which information can be passed between functions, such as global variables (§1.5), pointer and reference parameters (§3.6.1), and shared state in a class object (Chapter 4). Global variables are strongly discouraged as a known source of errors, and state should typically be shared only between functions jointly implementing a well-defined abstraction (e.g., member functions of a class; §2.3).

The return type of a function can be deduced from its return value. For example: Click here to view code image auto mul(int i, double d) { return i*d; }       // here, "auto" means "deduce the return type" This can be convenient, especially for generic functions (function templates; §6.3.1) and lambdas (§6.3.3), but should be used carefully because a deduced type does not offer a stable interface: a change to the implementation of the function (or lambda) can change the type.

Curiously — or maybe not — all the old ideologies are conservative because they believe in work. Some of them, like Marxism and most brands of anarchism, believe in work all the more fiercely because they believe in so little else. Liberals say we should end employment discrimination. I say we should end employment. Conservatives support right-to-work laws. Following Karl Marx’s wayward son-in-law Paul Lafargue I support the right to be lazy. Leftists favor full employment. Like the surrealists — except that I’m not kidding — I favor full unemployment. Trotskyists agitate for permanent revolution. I agitate for permanent revelry. But if all the ideologues (as they do) advocate work — and not only because they plan to make other people do theirs — they are strangely reluctant to say so. They will carry on endlessly about wages, hours, working conditions, exploitation, productivity, profitability. They’ll gladly talk about anything but work itself. These experts who offer to do our thinking for us rarely share their conclusions about work, for all its saliency in the lives of all of us. Among themselves they quibble over the details. Unions and management agree that we ought to sell the time of our lives in exchange for survival, although they haggle over the price. Marxists think we should be bossed by bureaucrats. Libertarians think we should be bossed by businessmen. Feminists don’t care which form bossing takes so long as the bosses are women.

Imagine a time before science, a time before libraries. Imagine a time hundreds of thousands of years ago. We were then just about as smart, just as curious, just as involved in things social and sexual. But the experiments had not yet been done, the inventions had not yet been made. It was the childhood of genus Homo. Imagine the time when fire was first discovered. What were human lives like then? What did our ancestors believe the stars were? Sometimes, in my fantasies, I imagine there was someone who thought like this:

Nature is not entirely unpredictable; there are rules even she must obey. This ordered and admirable character of the universe was called Cosmos.

That their influence was felt powerfully for only two or three centuries is an irreparable loss for all those human beings who lived between the Ionian Awakening and the Italian Renaissance.

In discussion it is not so much weight of authority as force of argument that should be demanded. Indeed, the authority of those who profess to teach is often a positive hindrance to those who desire to learn; they cease to employ their own judgment, and take what they perceive to be the verdict of their chosen master as settling the question. In fact I am not disposed to approve the practice traditionally ascribed to the Pythagoreans, who, when questioned as to the grounds of any assertion that they advanced in debate, are said to have been accustomed to reply “The Master said so,” “the Master” being Pythagoras. So potent was an opinion already decided, making authority prevail unsupported by reason.

There are an infinite number of regular polygons, but only five regular solids. (The proof of this statement, a famous example of mathematical reasoning, is given in Appendix 2.) For some reason, knowledge of a solid called the dodecahedron having twelve pentagons as sides seemed to them dangerous. It was mystically associated with the Cosmos. The other four regular solids were identified, somehow, with the four “elements” then imagined to constitute the world; earth, fire, air and water. The fifth regular solid must then, they thought, correspond to some fifth element that could only be the substance of the heavenly bodies. (This notion of a fifth essence is the origin of our word quintessence.) Ordinary people were to be kept ignorant of the dodecahedron.

Within it, organized into the local equivalent of galaxies and smaller structures, are an immense number of other, much tinier elementary particles, which are themselves universes at the next level and so on forever—an infinite downward regression, universes within universes, endlessly. And upward as well. Our familiar universe of galaxies and stars, planets and people, would be a single elementary particle in the next universe up, the first step of another infinite regress.

This is the only religious idea I know that surpasses the endless number of infinitely old cycling universes in Hindu cosmology. What would those other universes be like? Would they be built on different laws of physics? Would they have stars and galaxies and worlds, or something quite different? Might they be compatible with some unimaginably different form of life? To enter them, we would somehow have to penetrate a fourth physical dimension—not an easy undertaking, surely, but perhaps a black hole would provide a way.

*The laws of nature cannot be randomly reshuffled at the cusps. If the universe has already gone through many oscillations, many possible laws of gravity would have been so weak that, for any given initial expansion, the universe would not have held together. Once the universe stumbles upon such a gravitational law, it flies apart and has no further opportunity to experience another oscillation and another cusp and another set of laws of nature. Thus we can deduce from the fact that the universe exists either a finite age, or a severe restriction on the kinds of laws of nature permitted in each oscillation. If the laws of physics are not randomly reshuffled at the cusps, there must be a regularity, a set of rules, that determines which laws are permissible and which are not. Such a set of rules would comprise a new physics standing over the existing physics.

Because of erosion on the Earth, our monuments and artifacts will not, in the natural course of things, survive to the distant future. But the Voyager record is on its way out of the solar system. The erosion in interstellar space—chiefly cosmic rays and impacting dust grains—is so slow that the information on the record will last a billion years.

consider the alternative, the prospect that at least some civilizations learn to live with high technology; that the contradictions posed by the vagaries of past brain evolution are consciously resolved and do not lead to self-destruction; or that, even if major disturbances do occur, they are reversed in the subsequent billions of years of biological evolution. Such societies might live to a prosperous old age, their lifetimes measured perhaps on geological or stellar evolutionary time scales. If 1 percent of civilizations can survive technological adolescence, take the proper fork at this critical historical branch point and achieve maturity, then fL ≈ 1/100, N ≈ 107, and the number of extant civilizations in the Galaxy is in the millions. Thus, for all our concern about the possible unreliability of our estimates of the early factors in the Drake equation, which involve astronomy, organic chemistry and evolutionary biology, the principal uncertainty comes down to economics and politics and what, on Earth, we call human nature. It seems fairly clear that if self-destruction is not the overwhelmingly preponderant fate of galactic civilizations, then the sky is softly humming with messages from the stars. These estimates are stirring. They suggest that the receipt of a message from space is, even before we decode it, a profoundly hopeful sign. It

I mean, if there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that I never want to have a job again. I do math because I can't stop. Because I've found people who need my math to do something amazing. "If you need to pay me to do math, that's because a) you've figured out how to starve me unless I do a job, and b) you want me to do boring, stupid math with no intrinsic interest. A 'job creator' is someone who figures out how to threaten you with starvation unless you do something you don't want to do.

The seven factors needed for Awakening (satta bojjhaṅgā in Pali, sapta bodhyanga in Sanskrit) are samādhi, sati, pīti, passaddhi,upekkhā, dhamma vicaya, and viriya. The first five are characteristics of śamatha: samādhi, sati, pīti, passaddhi, and upekkhā. Four factors are required for vipassanā: samādhi, sati, dhamma vicaya, and viriya. Two factors, samādhi and sati, are common to both śamatha and vipassanā. So, the combination of śamatha and vipassanā provides all seven factors of Awakening. A mind in a state of śamatha is ripe with the potential for both vipassanā and Awakening, requiring only that phenomena be investigated (dhamma vicaya) with persistence (viriya). Likewise, a mind with vipassanā requires only śamatha for Awakening to occur.

Whether we’re awake or dreaming, this stream consists of sensations, thoughts, emotions, and the choices we make in response to them. That is our personal reality. The art and science of meditation helps us live a more fulfilling life, because it gives us the tools we need to examine and work with our conscious experience.

El Jardín no era un lugar de investigación, como el Liceo, ni una escuela de preparación en la política o en una planificación para construir, en la intimidad, una micrópolis organizada según la disciplina platónica, como la Academia. El Jardín fue, al parecer, un espacio ceñido por otros vínculos. Por supuesto que aquí se llevó a cabo una importante obra intelectual.

El cuerpo humano, que había llegado a sentir su lugar privilegiado en el mundo, constituía una deliciosa frontera donde el placer hacía consciente la oscura soledad de la carne. En los confines de la naturaleza había surgido, pues, esta redonda posibilidad de inteligencia y gozo.

Una actitud que, a pesar de todas las dificultades de la mente, de todas las limitaciones del cuerpo, significaba el descubrimiento del verdadero territorio en el que se asienta el hombre y del que arrancan sus más amplias y rigurosas posibilidades.

El compendio de nociones filosóficas que Epicuro resume en la mencionada carta constituye los principios que han de tenerse presentes, para que nuestra vida consiga una adecuada relación entre la teoría y la praxis, entre lo que pensamos que es la naturaleza que nos rodea y las relaciones de nuestra propia naturaleza con ella.

De modo que debe interesarse por la verdad tanto el joven como el viejo, aquel para al mismo tiempo que se hace viejo rejuvenecerse en dicha por la satisfacción de su comportamiento pasado, y este para al mismo tiempo que es viejo ser joven por su impavidez ante el futuro. Así, pues, es menester practicar la ciencia que trae la felicidad si es que, presente esta, tenemos todo, mientras, si está ausente, hacemos todo por tenerla.

Pues lo que con su presencia no molesta sin razón alguna hace sufrir cuando se espera. Así pues, el mal que más pone los pelos de punta, la muerte, no va nada con nosotros, justamente porque cuando existimos nosotros la muerte no está presente, y cuando la muerte está presente entonces nosotros no existimos. Por tanto, la muerte no tiene nada que ver ni con los vivos ni con los muertos, justamente porque con aquellos no tiene nada que ver y estos ya no existen. Por otro lado, el común de las gentes unas veces huye de la muerte por considerarla la más grande de las calamidades y otras veces la añora como solución a las calamidades de la vida.

Ansible modules are declarative; you use them to describe the state you want the server to be in. For example, you would invoke the user module like this to ensure there was an account named “deploy” in the “web” group: user: name=deploy group=web Modules are also idempotent. If the “deploy” user doesn’t exist, then Ansible will create it. If it does exist, then Ansible won’t do anything. Idempotence is a nice property because it means that it’s safe to run an Ansible playbook multiple times against a server. This is a big improvement over the homegrown shell script approach, where running the shell script a second time might have a different (and likely unintended) effect.

It’s much better to take the info that’s specific to your deployment, record it in one location, and then generate all of the files that need this information from templates.

We normally live completely immersed in the present—to such a degree, in fact, that we often fail to see how much our own social period differs from the past—indeed from a mere generation ago. This captivity to the contemporary can be very insidious. It may shackle us unknowingly to the most reactionary aspects of tradition, be they obsolete values and ideologies, hierarchical forms of organization, or one-sided modes of political behavior. Unless our roots in contemporary life are broadened by a rich perspective, they may easily distort our understanding of the world as it really is, as well as its rich potentialities for the future.

The means now exist for the development of the rounded man, the total man, freed of guilt and the workings of authoritarian modes of training, and given over to desire and the sensuous apprehension of the marvelous.

Imagine a scenario in which the operating logic of the capitalist system succeeds beyond anyone’s wildest expectations and the competitive process leads to “extreme productivity” and what economists call the “optimum general welfare”—an endgame in which intense competition forces the introduction of ever-leaner technology, boosting productivity to the optimum point in which each additional unit introduced for sale approaches “near zero” marginal cost. In other words, the cost of actually producing each additional unit—if fixed costs are not counted—becomes essentially zero, making the product nearly free. If that were to happen, profit, the lifeblood of capitalism, would dry up.

Because the commit pointed to by the branch you merged in was directly upstream of the commit you’re on, Git simply moves the pointer forward. To phrase that another way, when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit’s history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together—this is called a fast-forward.

A remote repository is generally a bare repository—a Git repository that has no working directory.

superforecasters were: pragmatic experts who drew on many analytical tools, with the choice of tool hinging on the particular problem they faced. These experts gathered as much information from as many sources as they could. When thinking, they often shifted mental gears, sprinkling their speech with transition markers such as “however,” “but,” “although,” and “on the other hand.” They talked about possibilities and probabilities, not certainties. And while no one likes to say “I was wrong,” these experts more readily admitted it and changed their minds.

the context in which BDD was born. It was a response to a triple conundrum: programmers didn’t want to write tests; testers didn’t want programmers writing tests; and business stakeholders didn’t see any value in anything that wasn’t production code. I didn’t think I was inventing a methodology—I was just trying to teach TDD to a bunch of programmers without scaring off the testers.

BDD is a mechanism for fostering collaboration and discovery through examples. The goal isn’t generating acceptance criteria or feature files; it isn’t automation; it isn’t testing; although BDD contains elements of all of these. I see teams obsessing about the number or density of feature files, or the degree of automation, or debating the merits of one tool over another. All of this is beside the point. The examples and scenarios of BDD are simply a form of documentation. More documentation isn’t better—better documentation is better! Don’t lose sight of the real goal, which is to use software to create business impact. BDD is just one way of staying focused on that goal, and is only useful to the extent that it helps with this. It isn’t an end in itself.

BDD practitioners use conversations around concrete examples of system behavior to help understand how features will provide value to the business.

BDD tools can help turn these requirements into automated tests that help guide the developer, verify the feature, and document what the application does.

Like Chris, Sarah talks to a business analyst about what she wants. To reduce the risk of misunderstandings and hidden assumptions, they talk through concrete examples of what the feature should do. Before work starts on the feature, the business analyst gets together with the developer and tester who will be working on it, and they have a conversation about the feature. In this conversation, they discuss and translate key examples of how the feature should work into a set of requirements written in a structured, English-language format often referred to as Gherkin. The developer uses a BDD tool to turn these requirements into a set of automated tests that run against the application code and help objectively determine when a feature is finished. The tester uses the results of these tests as the starting point for manual and exploratory tests. The automated tests act as low-level technical documentation, and provide up-to-date examples of how the system works. Sarah can review the test reports to see what features have been delivered, and whether they work the way she expected. Compared to Chris’s scenario, Sarah’s team makes heavy use of conversations and examples to reduce the amount of information lost in translation. Every stage beyond step 2 starts with the specifications written in Gherkin, which are based on concrete examples provided by Sarah. In this way, a great deal of the ambiguity in translating the client’s initial requirements into code, reports, and documentation is removed.

Rather than attempting to lock down the specifications at the start of the project, BDD practitioners assume that the requirements, or more precisely, their understanding of the requirements, will evolve and change throughout the life of a project. They try to get early feedback from the users and stakeholders to ensure that they’re on track, and change tack accordingly, instead of waiting until the end of the project to see if their assumptions about the business requirements were correct.

This is an account of the variation of living things during the course of countless generations and the way in which this results in new groupings of plants and animals; it treats both of the variability of domesticated animals and of variability under natural conditions, showing how such factors as the struggle for existence and natural selection operate to bring about and sustain such groupings; it argues that species are not fixed and immutable groups, but that they are merely varieties in transition from a less to a more marked and permanent status, supporting this argument by evidences from extinct animals found in the earth’s crust, and from comparative embryology and anatomy.

This is an inquiry into the source of national wealth in any economy that is built on a division of labor, considering the relation of the wages paid labor, the profits returned to capital, and the rent owed the landowner, as the prime factors in the price of commodities. It discusses the various ways in which capital can be more or less gainfully employed, and relates the origin and use of money to the accumulation and employment of capital. Examining the development of opulence in different nations and under different conditions, it compares the several systems of political economy, and argues for the beneficence of free trade.

There are two things we want you to note before we proceed. The first is how frequently you can expect the author, especially a good one, to help you to state the plan of his book. Despite that fact, most readers are at a total loss if you ask them to say briefly what the whole book is about. Partly this is owing to the widespread inability to speak concise English sentences. Partly it is owing to neglect of this rule in reading. But it also indicates that many readers pay as little attention to the author’s introductory words as they ordinarily do to his title.

He says: “A point is that which has no part.” How does that help to bring you to terms with him? You know, he assumes, what every other word in the sentence means with sufficient precision. You know that whatever has parts is a complex whole. You know that the opposite of complex is simple. To be simple is the same as to lack parts. You know that the use of the words “is” and “that which” means that the thing referred to must be an entity of some sort. Incidentally, it follows from all this that, if there are no physical things without parts, a point, as Euclid speaks of it, cannot be physical. This illustration is typical of the process by which you acquire meanings. You operate with meanings you already possess. If every word that was used in a definition had itself to be defined, nothing could ever be defined. If every word in a book you were reading was entirely strange to you, as in the case of a book in a totally foreign language, you could make no progress at all.

Recently, for example, we read an introduction to a new translation of the Koran that began by saying that to translate the Koran is impossible.

We would agree. But the difficult is not the impossible.

*** I. Surveying the Field Preparatory to Syntopical Reading --
I. Surveying the Field Preparatory to Syntopical Reading 1. Create a tentative bibliography of your subject by recourse to library catalogues, advisors, and bibliographies in books. 2. Inspect all of the books on the tentative bibliography to ascertain which are germane to your subject, and also to acquire a clearer idea of the subject. Note: These two steps are not, strictly speaking, chronologically distinct; that is, the two steps have an effect on each other, with the second, in particular, serving to modify the first. II. Syntopical Reading of the Bibliography Amassed in Stage I 1. Inspect the books already identified as relevant to your subject in Stage I in order to find the most relevant passages. 2. Bring the authors to terms by constructing a neutral terminology of the subject that all, or the great majority, of the authors can be interpreted as employing, whether they actually employ the words or not. 3. Establish a set of neutral propositions for all of the authors by framing a set of questions to which all or most of the authors can be interpreted as giving answers, whether they actually treat the questions explicitly or not. 4. Define the issues, both major and minor ones, by ranging the opposing answers of authors to the various questions on one side of an issue or another. You should remember that an issue does not always exist explicitly between or among authors, but that it sometimes has to be constructed by interpretation of the authors’ views on matters that may not have been their primary concern. 5. Analyze the discussion by ordering the questions and issues in such a way as to throw maximum light on the subject. More general issues should precede less general ones, and relations among issues should be clearly indicated. Note: Dialectical detachment or objectivity should, ideally, be maintained throughout. One way to insure this is always to accompany an interpretation of an author’s views on an issue with an actual quotation from his text.

According to the specs, the heating equipment soaks up 400 watts. Keeping it on would eat up 9800 watt hours per day. Over half my power supply, every day! But I do have a free source of heat: me.

I’m no stranger to Mars. I’ve been here a long time. But I’ve never been out of sight of the Hab before today. You wouldn’t think that would make a difference, but it does. As I made my way toward the RTG’s burial site, it hit me: Mars is a barren wasteland and I am completely alone here. I already knew that, of course. But there’s a difference between knowing it and really experiencing it. All around me there was nothing but dust, rocks, and endless empty desert in all directions. The planet’s famous red color is from iron oxide coating everything. So it’s not just a desert. It’s a desert so old it’s literally rusting.

Amazingly, some of the bacteria survived. The population is strong and growing. That’s pretty impressive, when you consider it was exposed to near-vacuum and subarctic temperatures for over twenty-four hours. My guess is pockets of ice formed around some of the bacteria, leaving a bubble of survivable pressure inside, and the cold wasn’t quite enough to kill them. With hundreds of millions of bacteria, it only takes one survivor to stave off extinction. Life is amazingly tenacious. They don’t want to die any more than I do.

石神抱著公事包走出家門，公事包裏，放著他在這個世上最在乎的東西。是他目前正在研究的某個數學理論的相關檔案。與其說目前，說是多年來持續研究至今，或許更為正確。畢竟，連大學的畢業論文，他都是以那個理論為研究主題，而且至今尚未完成。 　　要完成這個數學理論，恐怕還得再耗費二十年以上的光陰，他暗自估算著。弄得不好，說不定還得更久。正因為如此艱難，他堅信這才是最適合數學家投注一生的課題。而且，他也自負除了自己之外無人能夠完成。 　　如果能夠完成不須考慮其他，也不用被雜務剝奪時間，可以專心研究的話不知該有多好──石神常常馳騁在這樣的妄想中。每次只要想到有生之年不知是否能完成這個研究，他就惴惴不安地覺得把時間耗在其他不相干的事情實在可惜。 　　他決心不管去哪裏，都不能拋下這個檔案夾。他得珍惜分分秒秒，就算讓研究再進一步也好。只要有紙筆，這並非不可能。只要能繼續這個研究，他便別無所求

得到宠爱或遭受耻辱，都像是受到惊吓一样。重视大患，就好像重视自己的身体一样。什么叫作“宠辱若惊”？宠爱是卑下的，得到它会感到心惊不安，失去它也会惊恐万分。这就叫宠辱若惊。什么叫作“贵大患若身”？我之所以会有祸患，是因为我有这个身体；倘若没有了我的躯体，我还有什么祸患呢？所以，把天下看得和自己的生命一样宝贵的人，才可以把天下的重担交付于他；爱天下和爱自己的生命一样的人，才可以把天下的责任托付于他。
